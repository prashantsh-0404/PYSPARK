"Krasno Sauvignon Blanc-Ribolla Gialla 2021/22, Brda","Brda is known as 'the Tuscany of Slovenia'. It sits between the Alps and the Adriatic, just over the border from Friuli, Italy, where similar white wines demand much higher prices. But because Slovenian Sauvignon is still relatively under the radar, you can pick it up for a bargain. This is fresh and fruity, with aromas of green apple, pear, lemon and freshly cut grass. Try its refreshing acidity with oysters.",Â£9.99 per bottle,75CL,Sauvignon Blanc,Ribolla Gialla,Screwcap,9.8,"Green Apple, Citrus Fruit, Grass",per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Slovenia,,2022,

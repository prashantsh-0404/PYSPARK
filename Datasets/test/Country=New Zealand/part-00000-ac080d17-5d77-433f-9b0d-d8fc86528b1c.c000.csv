In 1996, having quit well-paid city jobs, Margaret and Tim Coney bought a paddock here. After dismissing several flocks of sheep, they set about planting the 16-hectare plot with 10,000 vines. Armed only with spades, this marked the beginning of their commitment to craft wines with a natural, hands-on approach. Martinborough’s cool climate is similar to that of Burgundy, so Pinot Noir thrives here. Pizzicato proves this time and again, having scooped awards for several of its vintages.

"Brancott Estate Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","Until the 1970s, Marlborough was assumed too cold for winemaking. That's until the founders of the Brancott Estate made the region's first ever Sauvignon Blanc in 1979. The wine that started it all tastes fantastic today, some fifty vintages later. It's crisp and ripe, with flavours of citrus, pear, tropical fruit and pink grapefruit.

"Devil's Creek Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","Once upon a time, Devil’s Creek was a mecca for prospectors. They flocked to the lush Marlborough valleys, panning for gold in the river. Today, it’s just liquid gold that’s left. Delicious, fruity, moreish gold – the Sauvignon Blanc which has made Marlborough world-famous. We’re lucky enough to have the UK exclusive on this – and all the wines from Devil’s Creek. With such excellent Sauvignon as this, we think it’s quite the coup. Gooseberry. Peach. Citrus.

"Saint Clair 'Pioneer Block' Sauvignon Blanc 2020/21, Wairau Valley","Saint Clair are one of the most awarded producers in Marlborough. They’ve been growing grapes there since the 1970s, so they really know the region inside out. They decided to put this knowledge to good use, creating single vineyard ‘block’ wines which are expressive of their particular patch. This Sauvignon is one of them. Because it’s so selective, they only make it in the very best vintages. It’s worth the wait.

This delicious rosé follows in the footsteps of the multi-award winning Sauvignon Blanc – our bestselling white wine.

"The King's Favour Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","Brent Marris is winemaking royalty. And it turns out, he may be descended from actual royalty too. His ancestor, William de Marisco was rumoured to be the illegitimate son of Henry I – not that that guaranteed the family good relations with royalty. The de Mariscos spent much of the 12th and 13th centuries living a life of piracy on the Isle of Lundy. Brent created the King Series to celebrate his family’s history, and their tempestuous relationship with the monarchy. This is a classic Waihopai Sauvignon Blanc – an important Marlborough sub-region where the wines are particularly vibrant. Think guava, gooseberry and a hint of blackcurrant leaf which sets this apart from the standard. Of course, it’s also mouth-wateringly fresh – a dream with barbecued fish with mango salsa.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,Sauvignon Blanc,,Screwcap,9.8,"Tropical Fruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit",per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty,2022,
"Definition Pinot Noir 2020/21, Marlborough","Kiwi Pinot Noir is a real success story. It’s no longer simply compared to Burgundy – it’s become a coveted style of Pinot in its own right. So, it was a no-brainer addition to our Definition range. We wanted something exciting to do justice to New Zealand’s pioneering spirit. So, we headed to Marlborough. The region’s history with Pinot is younger, but if there was anyone who could help us get the blend just right it was Marlborough and Pinot experts, Saint Clair. With them we selected grapes from top parcels in the Southern Valleys – the best site for Pinot in the region. The results speak for themselves. It’s deliciously savoury with classic Marlborough dark fruit. Think black cherry and raspberry. It’s perfumed but fresh, with fine tannins and a lovely silky texture.

"Definition Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","When we looked to define Marlborough Sauvignon, we knew we had to bring in the big guns. There was only one man for the job – Brent Marris, the winemaker behind our best-selling Kiwi Sauvignon, The Ned. We worked with Brent to cherry pick the very best grapes from specific parcels of vines. We wanted to go big on flavour and make it mouth-wateringly refreshing. The result? It’s the very best of Marlborough in a bottle. It’s a heady mix of fresh-cut grass, elderflower and passionfruit, with textbook freshness and citrusy flavours.

"Russian Jack Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","European settlers arrived in New Zealand in 1840, and set about clearing scrub from what are now top winemaking regions. Originally from Latvia, Russian Jack was one of these gentlemen of the road.  He'd appear on farms at harvest time to pick fruit, well into his old age. As a result, he became a bit of a legend. There's even a statue in his memory. And this wine lives up to his name. It's made with grapes from certified sustainable vineyards, and there’s no compromise on quality. Every vintage has only one bottling, with the wine left on its spent yeast cells (or ‘lees’) to concentrate the flavours and add texture. This is a seriously aromatic Sauvignon, with notes of passionfruit, elderflower and gooseberry. Try it with spicy grilled fish.",£12.99 per bottle,75CL,Sauvignon Blanc,,Screwcap,9.8,"Tropical Fruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit",per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty,2022,
"Jackson Estate 'Stich' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","This is named after Jackson Estate’s founder, John ‘Stich’ Stichbury, whose family have deep roots in Marlborough. But despite their long history, Jackson Estate have always preferred to keep production low key. They’re all about sustainably made wines, made with minimal winemaking intervention. This is released six months later than other Kiwi Sauvignons. That’s because it spends extra time ageing on the lees – giving a richness and roundness to the texture. This practice complements the restrained flavours, making for a more French, old-school style Sauvignon rather than the typical Marlborough tropical fruit-bomb. Think gooseberry and zingy rhubarb flavours that are perfect with goat's cheese.",£15.99 per bottle,75CL,Sauvignon Blanc,,Screwcap,9.8,"Tropical Fruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon, Stone Fruit",per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty,2022,
"Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2022/23, Marlborough","Cloudy Bay's huge success is largely down to groundbreaking Sauvignon Blanc. This is one of New Zealand's most celebrated wines and a real benchmark for quality. And remarkably, it will develop with age over the next five years. You can say the same for very few Sauvignon Blancs. Expect a complex and layered Sauvignon, with notes of ripe lemon, lime, passionfruit, peach and freshly cut grass. Serve this chilled with salmon. Please note, the 2022 vintage of this iconic wine has a brand-new look. Designed to reflect the mountains that are visible from the winery, this elegant embossed bottle is a tribute to the heritage and future of Cloudy Bay. We cannot guarantee that you will receive this new label –we can, however, guarantee the same outstanding quality across all vintages.",£29.99 per bottle,75CL,Sauvignon Blanc,,Screwcap,10.1,"Tropical Fruit, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon",per bottle,White,ABV 13.50%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty,2023,
"Greywacke Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","The first single-vineyard Sauvignon Blanc at Cloudy Bay was called Cloudy Bay Greywacke Vineyard. It was then that winemaker Kevin Judd registered the name Greywacke – just in case he ever needed it in the future. It was 16 years before he would. By then, Kevin had almost single-handedly put Marlborough on the map. Greywacke is his passion-project, his opportunity to make Sauvignon that's different to the typical herbaceous, tropical Marlborough style. He describes this as tasting like a sponge cake with lemon icing. It’s deliciously peachy, with flavours of melon and blackcurrant.

"The Ned Pinot Grigio 2022/23, Marlborough","We all know that The Ned is a sure sign of quality Kiwi wine, and their Pinot Grigio has become a bit of a cult favourite among Majestic customers. This is not your standard razor-sharp, green appley Pinot Grigio. It’s an altogether lusher style, closer to Pinot Gris. It’s instantly recognisable from its delicate salmon pink colour – made by leaving a portion of wine in contact with the skins. This intensifies the flavours and adds richness. It’s a beautifully aromatic and moreish wine. Think white peach, honeydew melon and a hint of baking spice. Its creamy texture is complemented by the refreshing finish. Delicious with grilled salmon.",£11.49 per bottle,75CL,Pinot Grigio,,Screwcap,10.5,"Pear Drop, Blossom, Green Fruit, Nectarine",per bottle,White,ABV 14.00%,Marlborough,Smooth & Light,2023,
"Framingham 'Nobody's Hero' Sauvignon Blanc 2020/22, Marlborough","Framingham does things differently. This Marlborough estate holds an outdoor rock concert every harvest. So, as you can imagine, their approach to winemaking is a little unconventional. We love the result. To preserve complexity, each parcel of fruit behind this bold Sauvignon is picked from several sites on Framingham's estate and vinified separately. The result is zesty Sauvignon full of rich guava, apple-skin and pineapple flavours.",£14.99 per bottle,75CL,Sauvignon Blanc,,Screwcap,10.1,"Tropical Fruit, Gooseberry, Grass, Green Apple, Lemon",per bottle,White,ABV 13.50%,Marlborough,Crisp & Zesty,2022,
"Baron Edmond de Rothschild 'Rimapere' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","You might not associate the Rothschild name with Marlborough, since the family are famed in Bordeaux for some of the finest châteaux in the world. But Benjamin de Rothschild was so fond of Marlborough Sauvignon, he bought the best land possible and flew in award-winning French winemaker, Anne Escalle in order to create his own. The winery is situated next to Cloudy Bay in what’s known as the ‘Golden Triangle’ –  arguably the oldest and most established spot of Marlborough. The Rothschild exacting requirements for excellence shine through in this single-vineyard Sauvignon. Expect aromas of lemon, gooseberry and green tea, plus a long, smooth finish.

Add barrel fermentation and 11 months of ageing, and you’re in for a seriously lush, complex wine. Discover intense flavours of citrus, peach and apricot with savoury notes of toast and hay.

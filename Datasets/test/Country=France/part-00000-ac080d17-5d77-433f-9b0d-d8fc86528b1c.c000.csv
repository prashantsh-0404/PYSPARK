So at first glance, it’s not the best place to grow Sauvignon Blanc and Picpoul (also known as Piquepoul). Both of these grapes need a bit of coolness to keep their crispness. Luckily, these grapes are grown close to the Thau lagoon. It’s the biggest saltwater lagoon in France – and it helps to moderate the intensity of the heat. This delicious Picpoul-Sauvignon Blanc has the best of both worlds. All the tropical fruit flavours which develop in intense sunshine – and all the cool-climate zing of a citrusy G&T. It’s lemony.

"Alain Grignon Carignan 'Vieilles Vignes' 2022, Pays de l'Hérault","Carignan can be a little rough and ready. It’s usually used to make simple table wine, but this is something quite different. Everything is focussed on quality. It’s made using grapes from at least fifty-year-old vines – some are even a hundred years old.

Part of it is aged in oak to give it some good structure, but it’s still a really juicy, fresh wine. It was made to be really easy-drinking – and it really does slip down oh-so-easily.

Royal Tokaji Late Harvest 2017/18 50cl,"Royal Tokaji was founded in 1990, when a small group of investors had the shared mission of creating a high quality range of traditional Hungarian wine styles. To do this, they brought together 62 small growers from some of Hungary's finest winemaking areas. Renowned for its incredible range of sweet wines, Royal Tokaji has since become one of the most important names in the wine world. This wine's sweetness is achieved by allowing the grapes extended ripening time on the vine, increasing their sugar content. Expect rich notes of ripe peach, exotic fruits and blossom.

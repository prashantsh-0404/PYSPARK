"Finca Carelio Tempranillo 2018/19, Spain","Spain’s wine laws are notoriously constrictive – so with Finca Carelio we decided to throw out the rulebook. Our buyers found the first Finca Carelio in the cellar of a top-name producer – we struck a bargain to declassify it and sell it at a low price for the quality. It was so popular that we did it again. This is a blend of wine from Castilla and Ribera del Duero – where wines are usually double the price. Rich. Ripe. Smooth. And full of jammy dark-fruit flavour. It’s deliciously easy drinking, with elegant tannins and spice.

And we’ve had to wait an awful long time for this. It’s made using grapes from vines up to an extraordinary eighty years old. Vines of this age yield really tiny portions of grapes so all the flavours are intensified – you can taste it in this deeply aromatic wine. It’s nutty, rich and full with a really moreish creamy texture. It’s a heady wine, packed with the flavours of ripe yellow fruits – but it’s also nice and crisp.

"Martín Códax Albariño 2021/22, Rías Baixas","Martín Códax was named after a Galician troubadour whose medieval poems are love songs to the sea. If the soil and the sun are the main characters in the story of Albariño, then the sea is the supporting act. The wild Atlantic coastline forces growers up to high altitudes. Here, the sea tempers the climate, so it’s more cool and damp than neighbouring regions. This Albariño is Rías Baixas in a bottle. The grapes are grown in terrifyingly steep amphitheatres overlooking the waves – you can taste the salt in the air in your glass.  Peachy. Citrusy. Fresh.

"Villarei Albariño 2021/22, Rías Baixas","Think Albariño, think citrussy, zingy, intensely refreshing whites. This wine has all that in spades – but it also has a little something extra. It’s from Val do Salnés, is the oldest sub-region of Rías Baxias right on the coast. It’s known as the birthplace of the Albariño grape – and it’s the coolest and wettest part of the region. It means the Albariños from here are extra crisp and green-fruity. They age this on the lees which gives the wine even more complexity and a lovely viscous texture which works incredibly with all those zingy, citrussy flavours. It’s a really special, unusual Albariño which is perfect if you love both crisp whites and richer styles of wine. But there’s a catch. Only 1,100 cases of this wine were made – so be quick.

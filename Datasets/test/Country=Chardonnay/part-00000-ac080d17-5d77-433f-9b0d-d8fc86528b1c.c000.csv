The majority of Bourgogne Chardonnay comes from Southern Burgundy. But this is made from vineyards located between Chablis and Sancerre. The cooler-than-usual climate equals a Bourgogne Blanc that’s elegantly Chablis-esque. If someone in your party considers themselves to be an ‘ABC’ drinker (Anything But Chardonnay) this is a bottle to convince them that the grape is worth another look. Expect lively notes of lemon,orange,pink grapefruit,white peach and acacia honey. A hint of aniseed adds to its length and freshness. Its crisp,"citrusy character makes it a wonderful match for fish and seafood.\"",£16.99 per bottle,75CL,,Natural Cork,France,9.4,"Grapefruit, Lemon, Orange, Peach",per bottle,White,ABV 12.50%,Bourgogne

"Leonidas Nassiakos ‘White Ash’ Assyrtiko 2020, Santorini","Generally speaking, wines are labelled as ‘old vines’ if the vines are 25 years or older. The Assyrtiko vineyards used to make this are between 50 and 70 years old – and it’s believed that a few vines may have been growing for up to 180 years. And it’s not just the vines that claim an impressive heritage. The two winemakers behind White Ash have worked across the Greek wine industry for decades to hone their knowledge and expertise. It’s aged for over a year on the lees (yeast cells) to give it more body and complexity. So along with the incredible depth of flavour that comes from old vines, you’re in for a seriously impressive and unique wine. Expect aromas of citrus and peach, combined with lively minerality thanks to volcanic soils. There’s a hint of honey alongside fresh-fruit flavours. Being an island wine, the perfect match would naturally be grilled fish or seafood.",£25.99 per bottle,75CL,Assyrtiko,,Natural Cork,10.1,"Citrus Fruit, Lemon, Peach, Stone Fruit",per bottle,White,ABV 13.50%,Greece,Ripe & Rounded,2020,

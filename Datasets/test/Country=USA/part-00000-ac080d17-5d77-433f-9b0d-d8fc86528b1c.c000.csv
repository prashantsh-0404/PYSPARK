"Managers’ Choice: Zocker Grüner Veltliner 2019/20, Edna Valley","Every year, we ask our store managers to choose their favourite bottle of wine from a delicious pool of contenders. This was their winner for 2022, and once you’ve tried it you’ll certainly see why.

It’s made with grapes from a single vineyard in Edna Valley, where cool ocean breezes give the fruit plenty of time to ripen and develop complex flavours.

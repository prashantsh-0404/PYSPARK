"Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","Oyster Bay has been an award-winning gold-standard Marlborough Sauvignon since its very first vintage, and it’s only got better and better. It was even formerly named the ‘Best Sauvignon Blanc in the World’ – and they have the name recognition to prove it. It’s really no surprise then that their Sauvignon is textbook Marlborough. Big. Fruity. Tropical. To say it’s mouth-wateringly refreshing is an understatement – the smell of gooseberries and lime will hit you the minute you unscrew the bottle. It’s really versatile – delicious as a glassful on sofa, for parties or with a flaky goat’s cheese tart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"La Gioiosa Prosecco DOC, Treviso","In Treviso, Prosecco’s heartland, the locals have a motto to describe their home – ‘marca gioiosa et amorosa’, it’s a ‘joyful and loving’ place. It inspired the Moretti Polegato family when they needed a name for their wine business. They’ve been making Prosecco for three generations and wanted a name that tied them to the land which had given them so much. ‘Gioiosa’ – ‘joyful’ was the perfect fit. These lively bubbles are wonderfully refreshing with notes of white blossom, pear and peachy stone fruit. The perfect apéritif or party wine – and delicious with canapés.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Macallan Sherry Oak 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky 70cl,"The Macallan’s rich heritage dates back to 1824 – they were one of the first distilleries in Scotland to be legally licensed. Since then they’ve built up a name as one of the world’s leading producers of single malt whisky. And their stellar reputation is down to their stringent standards for using the very best oak. This spends 12 years maturing in Oloroso sherry casks hand-picked by Macallan’s Master of Wood. The result? A complex sherried whisky with rich flavours of orange peel, dried fruit, vanilla, woodsmoke and spice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bouvet Ladubay Saumur Brut,"The Loire Valley’s Saumur Brut is the go-to appellation if you like premium sparkling wine – but not the high price tag. And this one is hands down our most popular bottle. Over its rich history, Bouvet Ladubay has been endorsed by Napoleon III and chosen as official supplier to the House of Lords. They specialise in bringing out the floral notes of Chenin Blanc, and it certainly shows in this lively, zesty fizz. Expect notes of honeysuckle, apple and lime, with a crisp, fresh finish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"LB7 Red 2020/21, Lisbon","Portuguese red blends are a Majestic speciality. They're easy-drinking, rich, packed with juicy fruit flavours and great value. Not to mention, they're a bit out of the ordinary. We looked for a blend of indigenous local grape varieties to give you something a little different and a lot more exciting. And we've really stepped up our game with this exclusive bottling. It's made by one of Portugal's most-awarded producers in homage to Lisbon's legendary food scene. It's big. It's bold.

"The Ned 'Waihopai River' Sauvignon Blanc 2023, Marlborough","Our bestselling white wine. Winemaker Brent Marris’ father was the first person to plant Sauvignon vines in Marlborough. Brent has had just as big an impact on Kiwi Sauvignon. He’s got rafts of awards to show for it, and that certainly reflects here. It’s the most refreshing thing you could pour into your glass. Full of gooseberry and grapefruit flavours, it’s grassy, tropical and seriously aromatic. Fantastic with Thai fishcakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moët & Chandon 'Brut Impérial' Champagne,"Moët is the ultimate celebratory fizz. The house is credited with inventing the Champagne glass pyramid. The victorious ‘spray’ of Champagne familiar to sport podiums is also down to them. But not only does their famous label put you in a party mood – it’s also a fantastic wine.

"Villa Maria 'Private Bin' Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","It took a lot of guts in the early 1960s, when George Fistonich – now Sir George – told his dad he was quitting a career in carpentry to try his hand at making wine. The gamble has seriously paid off. Villa Maria is a household name and the acclaimed producer is so successful it holds the coveted title as New Zealand’s most-awarded winery.

"Nyetimber 'Classic Cuvée' Brut, Sussex","Nyetimber's head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, was the first person outside Champagne to be awarded Sparkling Winemaker of the Year in 2018. She was also the first woman to win the accolade. Classic Cuvée is Nyetimber’s flagship fizz and it's made in the same way as traditional French sparkling, giving it equally complex flavours. Cherie is devoted to impeccably high standards at each stage of production. No wonder this has outperformed some of the finest Champagne in blind tastings. It has a stream of fine, delicate bubbles and flavours of toasted brioche, golden apple, honey and sweet spice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Try it with a grilled chicken salad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abbotts & Delaunay 'Les Fleurs Sauvages' Viognier 2021/22, Languedoc","If you love rich, fragrant white wines then this is an absolute must try. It’s rare to find impressive Condrieu-like flavour that’s also such great value. Winemaker Laurent Delaunay knows how to get the very best out of the sun-drenched vineyards in the shadow of the Pyrenees. The sun here concentrates the flavours in their grapes to incredible intensity. The wine is then aged in barrel on its lees, giving it a moreish, creamy texture. Expect plenty of lush apricot and peach flavours, with notes of almond and sweet ginger spice. Aromatic Viognier complements spicy foods brilliantly, so try this with chilli prawns with creamy yoghurt.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definition Chablis 2022,"The Definition range brings the world's greatest wine styles to Majestic customers. For the Definition Chablis, the brief was to find a classically lively, citrusy, slightly savoury wine. Our buyers found the perfect example. Find crisp citrus fruits, a hint of white flowers and a touch of oatmeal. It’ll go perfectly with smoked salmon and a squeeze of lemon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Definition Zinfandel 2019/20, Lodi","The Definition range brings the world's greatest wine styles to Majestic customers. The Zinfandel grape, a close relative of Primitivo, is big, bold and full of black-fruit flavour. It thrives in California’s hot, dry summers. So to create this, we went to Lodi in the Central Coast region, where Prohibition-surviving vines produce sun-soaked full-bodied reds. It’s classic Zinfandel, made by our buyers with a producer named ‘USA Producer of the Year’ five times. It’s rich and silky, with flavours of blackberry, plum and sweet spice. Try it with a hearty beef stew.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Vilarnau ‘Gaudi’ Organic Cava Brut Reserva, Penedès","This eye-catching bottle is inspired by Barcelona’s vibrant mosaic art, making it the ultimate centrepiece on any table. The Cava inside is just as impressive. It’s made by Vilarnau – one of the first wineries to be awarded the Wineries for Climate Protection certification. Energy comes from their biomass boiler and vineyards are irrigated from the rainwater filled lake that surrounds the winery – every decision made is with the aim of conserving their environment. All this care and attention results in happier vines, which means even more delicious wine. Their winemaker, Eva Plazas, is every bit as bubbly as the fizz she produces. She can be found cruising through the vineyards on her electric bike or showing guests the art of drinking from a traditional Spanish porron on the winery’s sunny terraces. Aged for 18 months ahead of release, this Brut Reserva makes the perfect apéritif. Expect bright notes of crisp apple, ripe pear and brioche.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pardon et Fils Fleurie 2021/22, Côte des Labourons","The acclaimed Pardon & Fils make this on the excellent Côte des Labourons area of Fleurie, one of the finest crus of Beaujolais.

"Thierry Delaunay 'Manoir' Sauvignon Blanc 2021/22, Touraine","The Loire is Sauvignon Blanc’s homeland. So it’s no surprise that Loire native Thierry Delaunay is passionate about the grape. Decades of family winemaking in the region means he has the pick of the crop when it comes to choosing grapes for his wines. He looks for the best grapes from the best pockets of vines in Touraine – and the results speak for themselves. This Sauvignon is seriously refreshing, seriously citrusy, and seriously good value. You’ll find nothing finer to pair with a goat’s cheese tart. And its more restrained flavour profile – less ripe and fruity than the standard Kiwi Sauvignon – makes it a perfect party wine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Château Minuty 'M de Minuty' Rosé 2021/22, Côtes de Provence","Thirty years ago, Minuty started making a new style of rosé, based on freshness above all else. These pale wines became the benchmark for today’s most popular style of rosé – refreshingly crisp and delicate Provence pink. And Minuty is still the gold standard.

Like the Guv'nor red, this sparkling wine is made from a number of Spain's most popular regions.

It's structured yet elegant, making it a wonderful choice for everything from roasted meats, cheese and charcuterie boards, to cosy fireside sipping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Definition White Burgundy 2021/22,"The Definition range brings the world's greatest wine styles to Majestic customers. If you uncork a 'white Burgundy’, you’re likely drinking Bourgogne Blanc – a wine that’s not from a designated area within the region. It’s the gold-standard for gently oaked Chardonnay the world over, so it's no wonder we added it to our Definition range. Burgundy can be a difficult region to get your head around with its many strict appellations guidelines. Thankfully this first tier of the regulations is simple – it’s where to look for value and quality. Expect lots of citrus, ripe apple and stone-fruit flavours. It’s zingy yet creamy from being aged in barrels for eight months. Perfect when matched with a buttery roast chicken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pringle Bay Sauvignon Blanc 2021/22, Western Cape","Winemakers Duncan Savage and Thys Louw are Sauvignon specialists with the toolkit to rival the freshest Marlborough Sauvignon.

Lively, fresh and full of raspberry, cherry and blackcurrant flavours.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gérard Bertrand 'Côte des Roses' Rosé 2021/22, Languedoc","Gérard Bertrand was once a famous rugby player. He’s now one of Southern France’s most acclaimed winemakers.

It's as bold and concentrated as Marlborough Sauvignon gets. It has powerful and juicy flavours of passionfruit, lime and gooseberry alongside thirst-quenching acidity. Great with fish and seafood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Devaux 'Oeil de Perdrix' Brut Rosé Champagne,"What do church organs and high-powered motorbikes have in common? They're the hobbies of Michel Parisot - how he spends his downtime from making sublime Champagnes. It's a fitting portrait of a winemaker whose approach to traditional fizz is decidedly unconventional. Michel is all about maximum flavour. Pinot Noir grapes are picked late in the harvest for as much aromatic flavour as possible. Michel then uses only the first press of the grapes, guaranteeing freshness. The wine is then aged for a minimum of four years – far longer than the required 30 months. The result is a rosé Champagne which punches well above its price point.  Expect moreish flavours of redcurrant and raspberry. Although it's dry in style, the creamy texture is perfect with fruity puddings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bouvet Ladubay 'Saphir' Saumur Brut 2020/21,"Love vintage Champagne, but not the price tag? Then you need to try Bouvet Ladubay’s Saphir Saumur Brut.

Ramón Bilbao 'Selección Especial' Rioja 2020/21,"The Tempranillo and Garnacha grapes used to make this are from all over Rioja. So you can be sure you're tasting the best fo the famous region. Ripe.

Delicious with smoked meats or spicy food.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ramos Reserva 2019/20 Vinho Regional Alentejano,"João Portugal Ramos started planting his own vines in Alentejo in 1990, gradually increasing the vineyard area and developing the winery.

"Definition Malbec 2021/22, Mendoza","Argentine Malbec is so popular, few people realise the grape is actually native to France. Mendoza, Argentina’s Malbec-heartland, is the place to look for the style of lush, fruity Malbec which put Argentina on the map. So, when we wanted to add a Malbec to our Definition range, Mendoza was the only place to look. Specifically, the Uco Valley – a sub-region where high-altitude vineyards make the very best Malbec. Working with a top producer, we sourced parcels of super-ripe fruit. The result? This plush, silky red which is all about the plummy, cherry fruit flavours. We only used a very small amount of oak to add a bit of structure, but not overpower the vibrant fruitiness. It’s a really classic style – so it’s perfect with a good steak or other barbecued meats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Definition Rioja Reserva 2017/18,"The Definition range brings the world's greatest wine styles to Majestic customers. And La Rioja Alta is the epitome of traditional Rioja producers. It’s still run by descendants of the five founders and prides itself on its classic style – so commissioning our Definition Rioja from them was a no-brainer. They employ their own cooper to make barrels, every single grape is picked by hand – the wines are even hand-racked by candlelight in the cathedral-like cellars beneath Haro’s cobbled streets. It’s a sophisticated wine with notes of red fruit, coconut and vanilla spice, and a really silky texture. As all Riojans know, its inviting aromatics make it a fantastic complement for slow-roasted lamb shoulder.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Definition Chenin Blanc 2021/22, South Africa","Chenin is a bit of a South African speciality – and nobody does it better than DeMorgenzon. So, it was natural that we’d source grapes for our Definition Chenin from them. Chenin is a lot like Chardonnay: it really picks up the character of its terroir. Made at high altitude, it’s like mountain air – fresh and pure. These vineyards are the first place the sun hits on the old road between Stellenbosch and Cape Town. All that sun ripens the grapes to absolute perfection, making the wine incredibly aromatic. Think mandarins and nectarines – a fruit salad of a wine, with aging on the lees giving it a lovely rich, honeyed texture. Heady and delicious. Try it with scallops or onion tart. The sweetness really complements this Chenin’s texture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M. Chapoutier 'Belleruche' Côtes du Rhône 2021/22,"With a name as well-known in the wine industry as Chapoutier, it's hard to believe that they were once seen as a disruptor. When Michel Chapoutier inherited the family business, he was determined to overhaul their whole process of winemaking to make wines which were as terroir-expressive as possible. His deliciously juicy Côtes du Rhône is a firm Majestic favourite. This wine was made without the use of oak, so it’s fruit-forward and with notes of ripe black cherry, herbs and a kick of peppery spice.

"The Ned 'Southern Valleys' Pinot Noir 2019/20, Marlborough","Marlborough Pinot Noir is a bit of an unsung gem. It’s often overshadowed by its regional sister, Sauvignon Blanc – but we think it’s fantastic if you love deeply fruity, silky reds. This is from the Southern Valleys, the prime spot for pernickety Pinot Noir which needs very specific soil and climate conditions to thrive. The grapes ripen slowly, developing really concentrated, berry-fruit flavours which are a trademark of the Marlborough style.

"Wynns Coonawarra Estate 'Black Label' Cabernet Sauvignon 2017/18/19, Coonawarra","Coonawarra's cool climate and famous terra rossa soils are now rightfully celebrated the world over. This region's reds are seen amongst Australia's greatest.

It has flavours of dark cherry, lavender and dried mint. The estate recommends trying it with fish tacos with green salsa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Veuve Clicquot Brut Champagne,"In 19th-century France, women weren’t even allowed to have bank accounts. So it's extraordinary that twenty-something Madame Clicquot turned her late husband’s business into the must-have Champagne of several European courts. Take a sip of their signature Brut and you’ll see exactly why. This is aged for twice the time legally required. The extra ageing brings biscuity and toasty flavour. It's rich – but balanced by ripe and zingy notes of citrus. Refreshing. Decadent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Porta 6 2020/21, Lisbon","We’ve become a bit of a specialist when it comes to Portuguese red blends – and this wine is why.

It'll make a fantastic partner for light fish dishes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Heidsieck & Co. Monopole 'Rose Top' Champagne,"Heidsieck & Co. founder Florens-Louis Heidsieck had the tall ambition of creating Champagne fit for a queen.

"Yealands Estate Single Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2022, Marlborough","Yealands were certified carbon-zero as soon as they started. Today, solar panels, vine-pruning burners and three wind turbines provide 25% of all of the energy used. Their head winemaker, Natalie Christiensen, was named as one of the World's Most Influential Women in Wine in 2018. Her skill certainly shows in this single-vineyard Sauvignon. It has intense aromas of lime, passionfruit, blackcurrant leaf and fresh herbs, and a distinctive mineral finish that's great with oysters. Bob Campbell MW gave the 2020 vintage 93 points.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sauternes, in Bordeaux, is responsible for some of the world's finest 'stickies'. The dessert wines here are made from rare Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc grapes and can age for decades.

Cune Rioja Reserva 2018/19,"Though it’s nearly 150 years old, CVNE is still run by the family of the brothers who founded it. Rioja is all about the oak ageing – so it’s strange to think that back in 1900 most wineries sold their wines as soon as possible. But the brothers changed this – creating an incredible ageing capacity of 80,000 bottles in their new winery. This Reserva reflects that focus on ageing. Rich. Warm. Vanilla-spiced. It’s aged in oak barrels for 50% longer than it legally needs to be, giving it more finesse, more coconut spice, more softness. It’s delicious – ideal with roast lamb or Spanish-style beef steaks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Journey’s End ‘Lone Creek’ Sauvignon Blanc 2021/22, Western Cape","The Gabb family is one of the UK's finest winemaking exports.

They’ve converted to solar power, become Fairtrade-certified and even launched a foundation to provide meals to the local community. It's no surprise they've recently been awarded Ethical Company of the Year by The Drinks Business – for the second year in a row. This Sauvignon Blanc is delicious proof of their passion and dedication. You’ll find it crisp and refreshing with notes of passionfruit, green apple and kiwi. Match its lively flavours with something equally aromatic, like an Asian-inspired fish dish with ginger and soy sauce.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Moillard-Thomas Chablis 2021/22,"Not much changes in the centuries-old vineyards of Burgundy, but that hasn’t stopped Moillard-Thomas from finding ways to innovate. One of the region’s oldest wine merchants, they respect the heritage of the land and its world-class grapes while using modern winemaking methods. For their Chablis, that means swift pressing after harvest and fermentation in thermo-regulated stainless steel vats. The result is a wine with complexity, minerality and fresh aromas of white-stone fruits and citrus. It’s already drinking well, but could continue to age well for a few more years. A natural match for oysters, sushi or goat’s cheese.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lyme Bay Chardonnay 2020/21, Essex","Your next favourite Chardonnay might just be from Essex vineyards. This area has a warm growing season and very little rainfall. That's why head winemaker James Lambert, who has decades of experience in English winemaking, specifically chose to grow Chardonnay here.

Its balancing salinity makes it an ideal pairing for oysters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fonseca Bin 27 Port,"Bin 27 is a reserve Port, made using the same approach to making a late-bottled vintage, with extended wood ageing making the wine ready to drink upon its release.

Apostoles 30-Year-Old Palo Cortado Sherry Gonzalez Byass Half Bottle,"Palo Cortado is a light wine chosen to be a Fino but instead aged oxidatively like an Oloroso whilst retaining some of the elegant Fino character. It is the rarest type of sherry and this example has had 30 years' ageing to gain even further complexity.

Elysium is Greek for Heaven, a fitting association for this excellent wine made by Andrew Quady. Virtually black in colour, with a rose-like aroma, very intense on the palate and full of fantastic rich velvety fruit. One of the few wines that can stand up to chocolate puddings. Or try it poured over ice cream for the ultimate after-dinner treat!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Viña Errázuriz ‘Estate Series’ Sauvignon Blanc 2021/22, Casablanca Valley","In 1870, Don Maximiano Errázuriz spent two days straight on horseback, travelling 100km north of Santiago on a quest to find a terroir he felt did justice to Chile’s wild spirit. In the shadow of the mountains at Aconcagua Valley, he found it. Maximiano was the first to introduce French grapes to the valley, founding a family winery which is still flourishing nearly 150 years later. It’s grown just a few kilometres inland of the Pacific, and the sea has a big impact on flavour. So it's incredibly fresh. It’s crisp. It’s zingy. But it’s also ripe with those delicious gooseberry and passion-fruit flavours we love in a Sauvignon. It’s incredible with ceviche – or tangy, dairy-based dishes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Gabb Family Vineyards Chardonnay 2020/21, South Africa","This is made on the Schapenberg Hills in South Africa’s picturesque Stellenbosch. Here, the influence of the nearby ocean encourages the kind of cool-climate Chardonnay traditionally associated with top Old World regions. But the name behind it is more than this pretty location. Journey's End have just been named Ethical Company of the Year by The Drinks Business for the second year in a row. They've also been supporting the wider community by providing 10,000 free meals a week via nine local soup kitchens. It’s fresh yet full-bodied, with notes of citrus, peach and butterscotch on the finish. Enjoy with meaty fish, like baked halibut, or mushroom risotto sprinkled with pine nuts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gonzalez Byass 'Noe' 30-Year-Old Pedro Ximenez Sherry Half Bottle,"Made from partially sun-and-air-dried grapes, which are then pressed, fermented, fortified, then aged in Gonzales-Byass's Nectar solera. A proportion is transferred to the Noe solera, where a blend of vintages of at least 30 years-of-age create this unique sherry. Thick, sticky, luscious and viscous, this sherry is super-sweet yet hugely complex and involving. Flavours of dates, cinnamon, clove, treacle and caramel combine like a silky, liquid pudding. Drink with Christmas pudding, or drizzle over quality vanilla ice cream for an indulgent treat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oyster Bay Merlot 2020/21, Hawke's Bay","Oyster Bay has been producing wine of international acclaim since winning the 'Best International Sauvignon' at the 1991 IWSC. A leading example of the 'New Zealand Style', fashioned from fruit grown in Hawkes Bay's Bordeaux-esque climate. Plumy, jammy and ripe berry fruits augmented by hints of spice, toasted oak and chocolate aromas are followed by a rich, rounded and fruity palate with subtle oak and spices and an intense finish. Enjoy over the next three years with everything from pizza to spaghetti bolognese and from roast turkey to pork chops.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Shaw + Smith Shiraz 2019, Australia","Shaw & Smith was founded in 1990 by Martin Shaw and Michael Hill-Smith, Australia’s first ever Australian Master of Wine. Thirty years later it’s one of most in demand names in Australian fine wine. In the cool-climate Adelaide Hills, the duo is committed to the finest soil and vine health, using grazing sheep to farm sustainably and picking every grape by hand. That’s a series of costly practices. But the result is some of the most elegant Shiraz you’ll discover in the New World. This is a restrained and sophisticated wine, with notes of blackberry, black pepper and well-integrated oak. It has ripe tannins that are fantastic with protein-rich meats, like sirloin steak.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Taittinger Comtes de Champagne 2011/12,"Produced exclusively from top quality Chardonnay grapes grown in 'Grand Cru' rated vineyards.

"Villa Maria 'Taylors Pass' Sauvignon Blanc 2020/21, Awatere Valley","If you're after the finest Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, this is a very credible contender. A previous vintage was the only Sauvignon Blanc to win 'Best in Show' at 2019's Decanter World Wine Awards. And it's made by New Zealand's most-awarded winery on a single vineyard, Taylors Pass, which has the perfect conditions for tropical Sauvignon Blanc. It's mouth-wateringly ripe, with flavours of passionfruit, gooseberry, lemongrass, lime and garden pea. It has a zippy acidity that's great with goat's cheese.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

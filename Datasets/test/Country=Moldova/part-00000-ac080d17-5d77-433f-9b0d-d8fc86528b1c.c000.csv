"Carpe Diem Feteasca Alba 2021/22, Moldova","No country better demonstrates the hidden treasures of Eastern Europe than Moldova. Many drinkers might regard it as a relatively new winemaking country; however, wines have been produced here for over five thousand years. Soviet times saw a drop off in quality and reputation, but producers such as Carpe Diem continue to set new trends for the industry. For four generations, the Lucas family have dedicated their lives to crafting expressive wines that reflect their unique terroir and local wine making traditions. However, the last century presented significant obstacles. In 1949, under the Soviet Union regime, the Lucas’ vineyards were nationalised and the whole of their family were deported to a Siberian labour camp. After several years, part of the family managed to return to the winery. And today, almost sixty years on, the Carpe Diem estate is thriving. While the Soviet threat has returned – with the winery pausing operations to aid their Ukrainian neighbours – their wines continue to go from strength to strength. Crafted from an indigenous variety, Feteasca Alba, this dry white has crisp notes of jasmine, white peach and newly cut grass. It’s light and fresh – perfect for serving as an apéritif or with soft cheeses.",£14.99 per bottle,750ML,Feteasca Alba,,Synthetic Cork,9.8,"Blossom, Citrus Fruit, Grass, Green Apple",per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Moldova,,2021,

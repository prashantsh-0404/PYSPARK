Chosen by Majestic Valpolicella Superiore DOC 2020/21,"We sent our award-winning buying team all around the world on an exciting new mission: to curate a new collection showcasing the best examples of key regions and core grape varietals – at great prices. Valpolicella is loved by Majestic customers – so we went to one of the oldest cooperatives in Verona to make this benchmark wine. Located in the hills north of the city, their vines have an average age of 30-35 years old – resulting in lower yields but more concentrated flavours. A classic blend of Corvina, Corvinone, Rondinella and Molinara, this is aged for an extra year before release, adding complexity and delicious vanilla spice.

"Beato Bartolomeo ‘Naturae' Pinot Noir 2021, Veneto","Pinot Noir isn’t often associated with Italy – but this famously finicky grape variety thrives in the country’s north east. In fact, it’s been grown in the Veneto region for centuries, and is even known locally as Pinot Nero. This exclusive bottling is made by Beato Bartolomeo, a cooperative based in Breganze DOC in the Alpine foothills. They’ve been making high quality wines since 1950, so they know just how to get the best out of their grapes.

And this crisp white is a case in point. It’s made from Vespaiolo, a grape variety that’s famously used to make sweet wines – and as you’ll see in this, it makes delicious dry styles too.

Domini Veneti 'La Casetta' Valpolicella Ripasso DOC Superiore 2019,"This is Valpolicella Ripasso with a difference. Ripasso wines are made by adding the leftover grape skins from Amarone production to standard Valpolicella, giving greater depth of flavour, texture and tannin. But Domini Veneti’s winemakers go a step further to make La Casetta. They re-ferment the wine with skins leftover from making Recioto – an intensely rich dessert wine – which pushes it into another dimension of flavour. Consider this an exceptional value ‘Baby Amarone’. It’s intense and spicy with rich, heady aromas. Expect notes of plum, cherry, chocolate and dried fruits.

It’s made by Pasqua, a historic family-run winery who are behind some of our best-selling bottles. So you can be sure you’re in for something delicious. It’s made from Corvina, Trebbiano, Syrah and Carménère grapes, which all thrive in Pasqua’s beautiful Veneto-based vineyards. Its name comes from the length of time the juice is left on the grape skins – exactly 11 minutes, the perfect amount of time to give the wine its delicate rosy colour.

"Pasqua 'PassioneSentimento' Passimento Rosso 2020/21, Veneto","This is one of our most popular Italian reds. It’s fantastically plush and full of flavour – all thanks to the ‘appassimento’ style of winemaking. This means the grapes are picked at the peak of their ripeness and left to dry in special crates until they’ve lost 30% of their volume. It concentrates all the sugars and flavours in the grapes, making the texture seriously lush and velvety. With this intensity you won’t believe the price. Think stewed plum, blackberry and juicy cherry flavour, with notes of violet and heady sweet spice.

"Pasqua 'PassioneSentimento' Passimento Bianco 2021, Veneto","Think ‘appassimento’, you'll most likely think Amarone – or other really plush reds. It’s a method of making wine with a portion of dried grapes, concentrating all the flavours and giving it a real richness of texture. But this wine is a little different. For a start, it’s white – and every single part of its production is designed to make it richer and more intensely flavoured. The grapes are left to dry in special racks, concentrating the sugars and aromas. After it’s pressed the wine is left on its skins to make the texture rounded and the flavours bolder. Finally, a portion is aged in oak for added creaminess. No wonder it’s a beast of a wine. Bold. Fruity. Plush. There’s a lovely balance of fresh citrus flavours and apricoty, peachy richness.

Villa Borghetti Valpolicella Ripasso 2020/21,"Love Amarone but don’t want to break the bank? Valpolicella Ripasso is for you – it’s even nicknamed ‘baby Amarone’. It’s made in a clever way which melds the fresh fruitiness of standard Valpolicella with the rich, bitter-chocolatey character of Amarone. How do they do it? The clue is in the name: Ripasso. It literally means to ‘re-pass’ – the method of re-fermenting normal Valpolicella wine with the leftover skins from Amarone production. It transforms the standard light-bodied Valpolicella into a soft, supple, full-bodied wine which is seriously moreish. Morello cherries. Blueberries. Liquorice.

His adventurous nature has led him to explore the production of a duo of red wines from his family estate in Valpolicella.

But while Barolo and Brunello have been around for centuries – even millennia – Amarone has only existed since 1938. How has it reached equal renown so quickly? In short: Amarone is unique. It’s made using dried grapes. That’s standard practice for sweet wines. as it reduces the water volume in the grapes, upping the percentage of sugar. But Amarone ferments the grapes to dryness, meaning it’s got a lot of alcohol, a lot of viscosity – and a lot of flavour. It makes for a seriously opulent wine. Plush.

This stops them from ripening further and allows them to dry in the wind, resulting in a concentrated and complex wine.

Grato Grati ‘Vecchia Annata’ Rosso Toscana 1999,"Despite the label, you can consider this bottle to be a Chianti Rufina Reserva DOCG – Chianti’s most northerly subzone – and the area renowned for making the region’s most long lived wines. Sat in the foothills of the Apennine mountains, vines here benefit from warm sunny days followed by cool nights. The huge changes in temperature results in wines with intense aromas and plenty of fresh acidity – and it’s this acidity that gives them their lengthy ageing potential. Due to a change in production rules in the 1980s, the prestigious Grato family can’t label this bottling a Chianti Rufina. They keep back some of their best cuvées, ageing them for longer than the DOCG panel allows. It means they become what's known as a declassified wine, but don’t let that fool you into thinking this is anything less than a first-rate Tuscan red. Predominantly Sangiovese, the blend spent 30 months in oak barrels, followed by further ageing in tank and bottle before release.

Roberto Sarotto Barbaresco Riserva 'Currà' 2016/17,"Barbaresco is the less tannic sibling of Barolo. The wine here is also made from the Nebbiolo grape, but typically aged for a shorter period. The pioneering family behind Roberto Sarotto make it on a single vineyard called Currà. It's complex, refined and smooth, with hints of roses, violet, plum, liquorice and chocolate. It was aged for two and a half years, so it's a harmonious wine that compliments red meats excellently.",£32.99 per bottle,75CL,Nebbiolo,,Natural Cork,11.3,"Violet, Herbaceous, Red Fruit",per bottle,Red,ABV 15.00%,Piedmont,Light & Elegant,2017,Barbaresco
Voerzio Martini 'La Serra' Barolo DOCG 2017,"The Voerzio brothers were part of the Barolo Boys, an iconic generation of winemakers that changed the world of Barolo wine. Gianni Voerzio's son, Mirko, today continues with their work. To create the most concentrated Barolo, he strictly limits the yields in the vineyard, allowing just 1kg of grapes per vine. It's no-expense-spared winemaking, and the benefits show in this bottle. Expect notes of plum, blackberry, spice and dried herbs and silk-smooth tannins, thanks to a very long ageing process. Drink now with grilled lamb, or cellar it for another 10 years.

Pasqua 'Romeo & Juliet' Prosecco DOC Rosé 2021/22,"Pasqua has been producing excellent Italian wine since 1925. Unlike many sweeter supermarket bottles, their Prosecco is made in a dry style, resulting in elegant, velvet-smooth bubbles.

La Gioiosa Prosecco DOC Rosé 2021/22,"Up until the end of 2020, producers weren't allowed to label rosé fizz as Prosecco – even if it was made inside the designated regions and to the same high standards as the classic white bubbles. But labelling laws have finally changed. And we're thrilled to be stocking one of the first rosé Proseccos to hit UK shelves. Best of all, it's made by Prosecco experts, La Gioiosa. Dry, fresh and zesty, with notes of redcurrants and raspberries, and a lovely floral quality. It's seriously moreish and perfect with raspberry soufflé.",£12.99 per bottle,75CL,Glera,Pinot Noir,Natural Cork,7.9,"Strawberry, Citrus Fruit, Raspberry, Red Fruit",per bottle,Rosé,ABV 10.50%,Prosecco Doc,Crisp & Fruity,2022,

Aqualta Prosecco DOC,"Prosecco is to Venice what pork pies are to Melton Mowbry. It’s part of the city’s identity. Venetians are just crazy about Prosecco – but not just any old fizz. They know the good stuff when they taste it, and they demand the very best. Our buyers tasted countless Proseccos to try and find the perfect union of flavour and value, but we couldn’t quite find what we were looking for. So, we decided to commission it. Aqualta was the result, made exclusively for us – and we think it’s the perfect Prosecco. It’s fragrant with really delicate aromas of apple and pear. The style’s typical of the super-fresh fizz served in backstreet bàcari; used to top up Venice’s signature spritzes, or chase a groaning table of cichèti. It’s a mouthwatering slice of Italy at home. Great flavour. Great value. Great fizz.

Fast forward to today and the sustainably run family estate is now world-renowned for its award-winning Prosecco, grappa and gin.

Tenuta Olim Bauda ‘Era’ Barbera D’Asti DOCG 2019,"Northern Italy is a fantastic area for showstopping red wines, but it’s the more bold styles, like Amarone, that often grab the headlines. For a more vibrant, youthful take on Italian reds, Barbera is not to be missed. Tenuta Olim Bauda forgoes the use of oak entirely in the making of this wine. The result? A fresh, fruit-forward style of Barbera with plenty of delicious unfiltered character and aromas of black cherry, chocolate and sweet spice.

Barbaresco 2019/20 De Forville,"Nebbiolo takes it name from 'nebbia', the fog cloaking the hills of Piedmont around harvest time. The village of Barbaresco lies only a little to the north-east of Barolo in Piedmont and produces wines of a similar style and quality. A big, elegant wine of pale colour. Dark cherries and leather with earthy hints, and a rose perfume, a charming, well integrated wine with a long finish. Muscular tannins give the wine a solid backbone. Try this with a fillet steak with mushrooms. The wine will nicely echo the earthy notes of the mushrooms.",£19.99 per bottle,75CL,Nebbiolo,,Natural Cork,10.5,"Spice, Earth, Leather, Red Fruit",per bottle,Red,ABV 14.00%,Piedmont,Light & Elegant,2019,Barbaresco

De Forville Dolcetto d'Alba 2020/21,"One of the lesser-known grapes of Piedmont, Dolcetto usually produces soft, fruity and early maturing wines. The best come from around Alba, as does this one from De Forville, a family that has been making wine in Piedmont since the 1860's. A clear and bright ruby in colour, with an expressive nose of youthful fruits. Rich, dark cherries and liquorice on the palate and a fresh finish.

G. D. Vajra ‘Albe’ Barolo DOCG 2017/18,"‘Sustainable’ and ‘organic’ may be buzzwords today, but the Vajra family has been championing both in Piedmont ever since the 1970s. At their vineyards, biodiversity is encouraged, whether it’s allowing grass to sprout in between rows of vineyards or birds to nest in the nearby forest. Huge amounts of manual work are put into producing each vintage of this excellent Barolo, which is made from 100% Nebbiolo grapes. It has aromas of redcurrant, strawberries and cherries and floral hints of rosebud and black fig.

"Pio Cesare Nebbiolo 2016/17, Langhe","Barolo may hog the limelight, but the larger region of Langhe in which it sits is home to some equally impressive Nebbiolo wines. Pio Cesare’s Barolo is world-renowned – and they pay just as much care and attention to this wine as their most sought-after bottles. Grapes are carefully hand-picked – including some from their highly-regarded Barolo and Barbaresco vineyards. The wine is then aged in oak for 24 months, creating a full-bodied, savoury red. It’s remarkably fresh, with intense notes of ripe and juicy red fruits.

"Contesa Pecorino 2021/22, Colline Pescaresi","Pecorino is an early ripening, thin-skinned grape, native to central parts of Italy. The bunches tend to be very triangular in shape, reminiscent of a sheep's head, said to be the reason for the grape's name. Pale yellow, with a remarkably intense nose of citrus fruits, hints of hawthorn and orange blossom. Soft, clean, but persistent palate texture, with a pleasing mineral complexity. Try with nutty cheeses, such as the wine's sheep's milk cheese namesake, or with simple cod dishes.",£9.99 per bottle,75CL,Pecorino,,Synthetic Cork,9.8,"Lemon, Blossom, Citrus Fruit, Green Apple",per bottle,White,ABV 13.00%,Abruzzo,Ripe & Rounded,2022,

DOC stands for Denominazione di Origine Controllata – and it means that wines here have a quality guarantee. This wine is a case in point. Zippy. Citrussy. Crisp. It’s a seriously refreshing glassful, full of zesty citrus flavours. It’s lemony. It’s refreshing. It’s got a lovely peach and white-blossom flavours too.

"Villa Tucci Bianco, Italy","Chieti in Abruzzo is one of the largest wine-producing provinces in Italy. Codice Citra was established in the 1970s with quality, not quantity in mind. Grapes are estate-grown and bottled from a collection of just 9 family-owned vineyards. Vines thrive in this area thanks to the unique climate. Warm winds blow in from the Adriatic sea, meeting the cooler air flowing down from the Majela mountains. The locals refer to the resulting valley breeze as ‘brezza di terra’ – and it’s this that encourages perfect grape ripening.

This rosé, a blend of gently pressed Turbiana and Rondinella grapes, hails from the latter. Head winemaker and family member Giancarlo Tommasi carefully vinifies the wine at controlled temperatures in stainless steel, creating a pale pink bottling with rich aromas of grapefruit, peach blossom and mandarin zest.

"Stone Arka Merlot 2017, Bulgaria","From the award winning winery, Yamantievs, located in the Thracian Valley, which is the perfect location for grape growing in Bulgaria. This Merlot has ripe black fruit & spice aromas with hints of plum. The palate is silky smooth, with an elegant black fruit & plum-skin tone. The acid & tannin balance is perfect - a silky scaffold holding a dark-fruit heart.  It will enhance any meal with lamb or venison, but is equally at home alongside a spicy mushroom cassoulet.",Â£9.99 per bottle,75CL,Merlot,,Screwcap,9.8,"Blackcurrant, Black Cherry, Blackberry",per bottle,Red,ABV 13.00%,Bulgaria,Soft & Fruity,2017,
